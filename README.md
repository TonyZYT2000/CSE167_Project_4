# CSE167 Project 4

## Description

This is the fourth project of [CSE167](http://ivl.calit2.net/wiki/index.php/CSE167F2020), an introductory computer graphic course taught in UCSD by Professor Schulze. It implements the lobby in the game Among Us. Players are rendered with toon shading. They move around randomly with collide detaction. They also appear and disappear at random time with particle effects.

## Build

The project is managed using Visual Studio on Win10. It depends on OpenGL, GLEW and GLM. With these dependencies configured correctly, this project should also be able to run on OS X and Linux. Instructions can be found [here](http://ivl.calit2.net/wiki/index.php/BasecodeCSE167F20).

## Usage

- Drag up and down to change viewing angle.
- Press `W`, `A`, `S` and `D` to move the lime green player around.
